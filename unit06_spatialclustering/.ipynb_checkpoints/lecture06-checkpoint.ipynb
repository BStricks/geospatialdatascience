    "## Clustering, spatial clustering, and geodemographics\n",
    "\n",
    "This session covers statistical clustering of spatial observations. Many questions and topics are complex phenomena that involve several dimensions and are hard to summarize into a single variable. In statistical terms, we call this family of problems *multivariate*, as opposed to *univariate* cases where only a single variable is considered in the analysis. Clustering tackles this kind of questions by reducing their dimensionality -the number of relevant variables the analyst needs to look at- and converting it into a more intuitive set of classes that even non-technical audiences can look at and make sense of. For this reason, it is widely use in applied contexts such as policymaking or marketting. In addition, since these methods do not require many preliminary assumptions about the structure of the data, it is a commonly used exploratory tool, as it can quickly give clues about the shape, form and content of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of statistical clustering is to summarize the information contained in several variables by creating a relatively small number of categories. Each observation in the dataset is then assigned to one, and only one, category depending on its values for the variables originally considered in the classification. If done correctly, the exercise reduces the complexity of a multi-dimensional problem while retaining all the meaningful information contained in the original dataset. This is because, once classified, the analyst only needs to look at in which category every observation falls into, instead of considering the multiple values associated with each of the variables and trying to figure out how to put them together in a coherent sense. When the clustering is performed on observations that represent areas, the technique is often called geodemographic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there exist many techniques to statistically group observations in a dataset, all of them are based on the premise of using a set of attributes to define classes or categories of observations that are similar *within* each of them, but differ *between* groups. How similarity within groups and dissimilarity between them is defined and how the classification algorithm is operationalized is what makes techniques differ and also what makes each of them particularly well suited for specific problems or types of data. As an illustration, we will only dip our toes into one of these methods, K-means, which is probably the most commonly used technique for statistical clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of analysing spatial data, there is a subset of methods that are of particular interest for many common cases in Geographic Data Science. These are the so-called *regionalization* techniques. Regionalization methods can take also many forms and faces but, at their core, they all involve statistical clustering of observations with the additional constraint that observations need to be geographical neighbors to be in the same category. Because of this, rather than category, we will use the term *area* for each observation and *region* for each category, hence regionalization, the construction of regions from smaller areas."

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use in this occasion is an extract from the online website [AirBnb](http://www.airbnb.com). AirBnb is a company that provides a meeting point for people looking for an alternative to a hotel when they visit a city, and locals who want to rent (part of) their house to make some extra money. The website has a continuously updated listing of all the available properties in a given city that customers can check and book through. In addition, the website also provides a feedback mechanism by which both ends, hosts and guests, can rate their experience. Aggregating ratings from guests about the properties where they have stayed, AirBnb provides additional information for every property, such as an overall cleanliness score or an index of how good the host is at communicating with the guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data are provided at the property level and for the entire London. However, since the total number of properties is very large for the purposes of this notebook, they have been aggregated at the Middle Super Output Area (MSOA), a geographical unit created by the Office of National Statistics. Although the original source contains information for the Greater London, the vast majority of properties are located in Inner London, so the data we will use is restricted to that extent. Even in this case, not every polygon has at least one property. To avoid cases of missing values, the final dataset only contains those MSOAs with at least one property, so there can be average ratings associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this notebook is to create a classification of areas (MSOAs) in Inner London based on the ratings of the AirBnb locations. This will allow us to create a typology for the geography of AirBnb in London and, to the extent the AirBnb locations can say something about the areas where they are located, the classification will help us understand the geography of residential London a bit better. One general caveat about the conclusions we can draw from an analysis like this one that derives from the nature of AirBnb data. On the one hand, this dataset is a good example of the kind of analyses that the data revolution is making possible as, only a few years ago, it would have been very hard to obtain a similarly large survey of properties with ratings like this one. On the other hand, it is important to keep in mind the kinds of biases that these data are subject to and thus the limitations in terms of generalizing findings to the general population. At any rate, this dataset is a great example to learn about statistical clustering of spatial observations, both in a geodemographic as well as in a regionalization.\n",

   "source": [
    "A geodemographic analysis involves the classification of the areas that make up a geographical map into groups or categories of observations that are similar within each other but different between them. The classification is carried out using a statistical clustering algorithm that takes as input a set of attributes and returns the group (\"labels\" in the terminology) each observation belongs to. Depending on the particular algorithm employed, additional parameters, such as the desired number of clusters employed or more advanced tuning parameters (e.g. bandwith, radius, etc.), also need to be entered as inputs. For our geodemographic classification of AirBnb ratings in Inner London, we will use one of the most popular clustering algorithms: K-means.

    "\n",
    "Regionalization is the subset of clustering techniques that impose a spatial constraint on the classification. In other words, the result of a regionalization algorithm contains areas that are spatially contiguous. Effectively, what this means is that these techniques aggregate areas into a smaller set of larger ones, called regions. In this context then, areas are *nested* within regions. Real world examples of this phenomenon includes counties within states or, in the UK, local super output areas (LSOAs) into middle super output areas (MSOAs). The difference between those examples and the output of a regionalization algorithm is that while the former are aggregated based on administrative principles, the latter follows a statistical technique that, very much the same as in the standard statistical clustering, groups together areas that are similar on the basis of a set of attributes. Only that now, such statistical clustering is spatially constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the non-spatial case, there are many different algorithms to perform regionalization, and they all differ on details relating to the way they measure (dis)similarity, the process to regionalize, etc. However, same as above too, they all share a few common aspects. In particular, they all take a set of input attributes *and* a representation of space in the form of a binary spatial weights matrix. Depending on the algorithm, they also require the desired number of output regions into which the areas are aggregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these concepts, we will run a regionalization algorithm on the AirBnb data we have been using. In this case, the goal will be to re-delineate the boundary lines of the Inner London boroughs following a rationale based on the different average ratings on AirBnb properties, instead of the administrative reasons behind the existing boundary lines. In this way, the resulting regions will represent a consistent set of areas that are similar with each other in terms of the ratings received."

    "Looking at the figure, there are several differences between the two maps. The clearest one is that, while the administrative boundaries have a very balanced size (with the exception of the city of London), the regions created with the spatial agglomerative algorithm are very different in terms of size between each other. This is a consequence of both the nature of the underlying data and the algorithm itself. Substantively, this shows how, based on AirBnb, we can observe large areas that are similar and hence are grouped into the same region, while there also exist pockets with characteristics different enough to be assigned into a different region."
