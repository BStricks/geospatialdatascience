What is the most general definition of a neighbor of an object i:
1) an object next to i
2) an object closer to i than a certain distance
*3) an object with weight>0 in row i of the spatial weight matrix
4) an object sharing a boundary with i


Given a standardized spatial weight matrix, what is the spatial lag of an object?
*1) the average of the values of all its neighbors
2) the sum of the values of all its neighbors
3) the sum of the reciprocal values of all its neighbors
4) the sum of all values minus the average distance


Assume a standardized spatial weight matrix with rook contiguity. What is the spatial lag of the central object in this map?
1) 120
2) 40
3) 20
4) 15
*5) 10


Assume a non-standardized spatial weight matrix with queen contiguity. What is the spatial lag of the central object in this map?
*1) 120
2) 40
3) 20
4) 15
5) 10


When can a spatial weight matrix W not be standardized?
*1) when there is a row in W with only zeros
2) when not all rows in W sum up to 1
3) when W is asymmetric


The MAUP is a problem about
1) classifying values
*2) aggregating objects in space
3) aggregating objects in time
4) choosing colors for a choropleth map


What does it mean when Moran's I is positive?
1) there are many clusters with dissimilar objects
*2) after reshuffling, objects and their neighbors become less similar
3) after reshuffling, objects and their neighbors become more similar


What does it mean when Moran's I has a low p-value?
1) it is likely to observe a similarly extreme I after reshuffling
*2) it is unlikely to observe a similarly extreme I after reshuffling
3) clusters are small
4) clusters are large
